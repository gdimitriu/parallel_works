# Static openMosix configuration
# ==============================
#
# Each line in this file should contain 3 fields, statically mapping
# IP addresses to openMosix node-numbers:
#
# 1) The first openMosix node-number in this range.
# 2) The IP address of the above node (or node-name from /etc/hosts).
# 3) The number of nodes in this range.
#
# Note: If you don't create a valid IP <-> node-number mapping, the
#	autodiscovery daemon will be started, automatically assigning
#	node-numbers to all visible openMosix machines.
#
# Example: 10 machines with IP addresses 192.168.1.50 - 192.168.1.59
#	   which will have openMosix node-numbers 1-10:
#
# 1	   192.168.1.50	    10
#
# MOSIX-#  IP  number-of-nodes
