# parallel works
some project on parallel computing.

Test for openMP, threads, MPI, upc on different systems.

Gauss-Jordan, Gaussian Elimination, Jacobi are used to see the speedup of different systems.

Tests are done in 2003-2006 on old systems including AIX F40, Intel Dual Processor, LAN of computers and a SUN multiprocessor.

Mpich 1.9.5 and Mpich 2.0, mochi-g2 for globus also native threads, Intel C compiler and Omni as openMP distribution.

This is an archive for a lot of tests.
